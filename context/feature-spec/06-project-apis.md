# Project API

The database schema is ready. Build the backend project API routes only.

## Routes

Create REST endpoints for:

- `GET /api/projects`, list current user's project
- `POST /api/projects` create project
- `PATCH /api/projects/[projectId]`, rename project
- `DELETE /api/projects/[projectId]`,  delete project

## Rules

Use the authenticated Clerk user ID as `ownerId`.

*when creating*:

- default missing project name to `Untitled Project`
- use the schema's existing ID strategy, do not add sequential IDs

*Security:*

- unauthenticated requests return `401`
- only the project owner can rename or delete
- non-owner mutations return `403`

Keep this backend-only. Do not wire the UI yet.

## Check when done

- Routes exist for list/create/rename/delete
- owner checks are enforced for rename/delete
- `401` and `403` response are handled correctly
- `npm run build` passes
